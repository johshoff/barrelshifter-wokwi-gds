  description:  "Shifts a 6 bit number up to 0-3 bits left"
  how_it_works: "An 6 bit input value and 2 bit shift amount is provided, and the shifted value will be in the output"
  how_to_test:  "Choose an input value (like 6'b001010) and a shift amount (like 2'b10) and combine it into input pins (like 8'b00101010) and observe that the output is the shifted input (like 8'b10100000)"

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - bit 5 (most significant) of input value
    - bit 4 of input value
    - bit 3 of input value
    - bit 2 of input value
    - bit 1 of input value
    - bit 0 (least significant) of input value
    - bit 5 (most significant) of shift amount
    - bit 0 (least significant) of shift amount
  outputs:
    - bit 7 (most significant) of shifted value
    - bit 6 of shifted value
    - bit 5 of shifted value
    - bit 4 of shifted value
    - bit 3 of shifted value
    - bit 2 of shifted value
    - bit 1 of shifted value
    - bit 0 (least significant) of shifted value
